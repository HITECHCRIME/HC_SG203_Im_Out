## Lyrics

```
I'm out for calling you to stop
I don't revolve around your thoughts
Prefer to stay away from motives
Keeping me around the clock
Mind locked on targets 
they evolve to find unknown
recall the agents paid to
trace i'm too alone too alone

way too silent, bound for a fall
to grasp where the pain is from
where the pain is found
i need to track that comm coz
gotta make it home, stuck in doubts




bring up memories that made me stay
evolve to find unknown


to a low that's (I'm too alone)
 - 






```
