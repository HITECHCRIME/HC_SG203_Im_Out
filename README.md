## Lyrics

```
I'm out for calling you to stop, I don't revolve around your thoughts
Prefer to stay away from motives, Keeping me around the clock
Mind locked on targets, they evolve to find unknown
Recall the agents paid to trace, i'm too alone i'm too alone

Way too silent, bound for a fall to grasp where the pain is from
Where the pain is found, where my soul is born, gotta make it home, stuck in doubts
i need to track that comm, gotta make it out, ease the pain inside, into flames i shout 
i am fine i am fine still alone


bring up memories that made me stay
evolve to find unknown
to a low that's (I'm too alone)
 - 






```
